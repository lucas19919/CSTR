# CSTR



simple CSTR simulation project consisting of a C# dotnet core API backend, react js and tremor frontend, and a reinforcement learning model optimized using python and tensorflow. This model is then implemented into the backend via a onnx file 



goal of the project has been to find the optimal operating conditions of a CSTR, to optimize conversion and throughput. Model has been trained to maximize conversion rate, minimize energy costs (temp of inlet and coolant temp), whilst preventing runaway reactions



note: the ui was not designed by me, and neither was the majority of the frontend. the frontend was instead designed by using gemini, with minimal tweaks. The backend and python scripts were also aided by AI.
