# CSTR



simple CSTR simulation project consisting of a C# dotnet core API backend, react js and tremor frontend, and a reinforcement learning model optimized using python and pytorch.



note: the ui was not designed by me, and neither was the majority of the frontend. the frontend was instead designed by using gemini, with minimal tweaks. The backend and python scripts were also aided by AI.



currently unfinished and neural network has not been added yet. simulation is mostly stable with some anomalies when values are scaled largely
